        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
            Are you facing life challeges? Do you think there is no way out? Maybe you have just broke up, just lost a family member, having a huge debt...</p>
        <p>You have made so many bad decisions, didn't realise the problems and change them right away. And, it is too late now!
        </p>
        <p>Have you even wish to have a button, that once pressed, can reset your life. I mean, like in a video game. You can try again and live a better life. We all need this very one chance, oftern the last chance we would have.</p>
        <p>We, Clean Water, have invented such a button.</p>

        <a id="how-it-works" class="target">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h2>How it works?</h2>
        <p>It uses 70% cutting-edge quantum mechanics technology mixed with 30% magic. It connects to a parallel university and reconstruct a virtual world in the Martix. So that you can a second chance to live.</p>

    <div>
        <div class="anchor">
        <a id="pricing" class="taget">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <p>When you read upon this sentence here, you must think it is another fraud. The button must cost tremendous amount of money and you are planning to close the window tab. But wait:</p>
        <strong>It is 100% free. </strong>

        <p>But I did lie in the "How it works?" sections. If you want to know the real mechanism of this button, please read on.</p>

    <div>
        <div class="anchor">
        <a id="is-it-real" class="target">&nbsp;</a>
    </div>
        <h2>Is it real?</h2>
        <strong>Yes, it is real.</strong>
        <p>The button do exist. But it does not work like what I have said. The button is not in a physcial form. The button is in your mind. Also, there is no quantum mechanics nor magic. It is all about your willpower. And remember, I have never said the button will work overnight, instead, it takes a year or two to show its effect. </p>
